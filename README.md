### ComIcon

ComIcon is a website that provides icons of your favourite comic book characters from Marvel, DC, graphic novels, and more! For this project, I created 10 Marvel charcater icons. These characters include: Daredevil, Deadpool, Dr. Doom, Dr. Strange, Iron Fist, Iron Man, The Punisher, Spider-Man, Thor, and Wolverine.

The icons are initially in grayscale but grow in size and colourize when they are hovered over. If you click on an icon, the ID is logged in the console and a modal pops up giving you a little bit of information on the character.
